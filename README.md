# PLC-Data-Collection
Creating PLC data collection Programs

This is a program that will connect to an Allen Bradley Logix 5000 PLC and pull data from tags requested from it and store data in an excel sheet
by date AND shift.  In this case it only had 2 shifts but you could add another.  This program will email you a copy of the excel sheet ( as long as you are connected to same network ) at a given time ( set inside code of program ), agian its setup to send twice a day 3:45pm and 2am but you can change it or have it not send at all.


PLEASE NOTE:
I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL C# PROGRAMMER!! I know a little of this and a little of that, I am making one for python as well but thats still in the works.
Im a controls engineer by trade and like to dabble in programming on the side.  I wish the program was a bit more modular but one step at a time!
